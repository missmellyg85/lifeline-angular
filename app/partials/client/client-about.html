<h1>About Us</h1>
<div class="content">
    <p>Lifeline Pregnancy Help Clinic is a non-profit, Christ-centered organization that upholds the value of human life through the care of pregnant women and those affected by an unplanned pregnancy. We exist to save and change lives.</p>
    <p>Lifeline was established in 1997 and since has been serving women and families from all of Northeast Missouri. Our service areas are broad, but our overall goal is the same: to serve all with an open heart and open arms as they progress through pregnancy and into parenthood.</p>
