			<ul type="square" style="padding-left:10px;">
			<li>My husband or boyfriend doesn't want the baby but I do </li>
			<li>(for men) My girlfriend doesn't want the baby but I do </li>
			<li>I can't tell my family </li>
			<li>How will I finish school? </li>
			<li>How will I continue working? </li>
			<li>Where will I live? </li>
			<li>I don't have medical insurance </li>
			<li>I can't afford a child </li>
			<li>I'm too young </li>

			<a class="video" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGCxBmoAIAE&amp;feature" target="_blank"><img class="border" src="assets/images/aboutLove.jpg" width="340" height="270" /></a>
			<ul type="square" style="padding-left:10px;">
			<li>Don't want an abortion and aren't ready to be a parent </li>
			<li>Want to provide your child with a 2-parent family </li>
			<li>Want to provide your child emotional and financial stability. </li>

			We can help you understand your options with adoption.</p>
			</p>
			<h1>Abortion</h1>
			<p>If you're thinking about finding an abortion clinic, it is important to remember  							      	that abortion is a medical procedure. What type will you have? What are the risks? 	  		You deserve to know the facts. You owe it to yourself to make an informed decision.
			Perhaps you're thinking:
			<a class="video" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVFm8II88b0&amp;feature" target="_blank"><img class="border" src="assets/images/medTestimony.jpg" width="340" height="270" /></a>
			<ul type="square" style="padding-left:10px;">
				<li>The father is insisting on an abortion </li>
				<li>I'm not ready to be a parent </li>
				<li>I can't tell anyone I'm pregnant </li>
			</ul>

			We know exactly how you feel and you're not alone. If you're considering abortion, you need to know:
			<ul type="square" style="padding-left:10px">
			<li>Are you really pregnant? </li>
			<li>Is your pregnancy normal? Or are you at risk for natural miscarriage? Or do      you have a tubal pregnancy requiring immediate medical attention? </li>
			<li>How far along are you? </li>
			</ul>
			<p>You may also be interested in knowing:</p>
			<ul type="square" style="padding-left:10px;">
			<li>What kind of abortions are available to you? </li>
			<li>What are your rights with abortion providers? </li>
			<li>Are there any short-term or long-term risks to consider? </li>
			</ul>
			<p>We can help you understand your choices, pregnancy, health and options.</p>
