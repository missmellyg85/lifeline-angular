			<h1>Pregnancy Symptoms</h1><img align="right" src="assets/images/pregnancy.jpg" />
			<p>Don't get caught worrying about being pregnant before you  are sure. A missed period is the most common indication, but it doesn't  necessarily mean you are pregnant.</p>
			<h2>Common pregnancy symptoms:</h2>
			<ul type="square">
				<li>Late period </li>
				<li>Tender or swollen breasts </li>
				<li>Frequent urination </li>
				<li>Nausea or vomiting </li>
				<li>Fatigue </li>
				<li>Lightheadedness or fainting </li>
				<li>Backaches </li>
				<li>Food cravings or aversions </li>
				<li>Darkening of the nipples </li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Lifeline </strong>will  provide you with a free lab-certified pregnancy test. You will have the results  during your appointment. A positive test may be followed by a limited obstetrical ultrasound for patients who meet qualifying criteria.<br />
			Call us today to schedule a confidential appointment.</p>
			<h2>How accurate is the test?</h2>
			<p>Our tests are laboratory rated. They can detect the hCG  pregnancy hormone as early as 7 days after conception or 21 to 24 days after  the first day of your last period. The test is over 99% accurate.</p>
			<h2>Can I have a retest if my test is negative and my period doesn't start?</h2>
			<p>Yes, you may be rescheduled for another test. The hCG  hormone doubles every 2.2 days during the first three months of pregnancy.</p>
			<h2>Should I see a doctor if I have a second negative test and have not started  my period?</h2>
			<p>If you have concerns about missed periods and your  pregnancy test continues to be negative, you should see your health care  provider for assessment. If you need resources for health care, <strong>Lifeline</strong> can provide you referrals.</p>
