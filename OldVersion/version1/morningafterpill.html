      <h1>Morning After Pill (Plan B)</h1><img align="right" src="assets/images/pills.jpg" />
      <p>Before taking the Morning After Pill, you should  understand what it is, what it could mean to your health and how it works. Call  for an appointment and one of our staff will be happy to discuss it with you,  confirm if you're pregnant and advise you on your options.</p>
      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p>The “morning after pill” is a large dose of oral  contraceptive. Known as Plan B, the pill is actually 2 tablets, one taken  within 72 hours of intercourse and the second 12 hours later. It is NOT the  same as RU-486.</p>
      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>Plan B is believed to act as an emergency contraceptive  principally by preventing ovulation or fertilization. In addition, it may  inhibit implantation. It is not effective once the process of implantation has  begun.</p>
      <h2>Things to consider</h2>
      <ul type="square">
        <li>Emergency contraception is not effective if a woman is already       pregnant. </li>
        <li>Plan B does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other       sexually transmitted diseases. </li>
        <li>The most common side effects in the Plan B clinical trial were       nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, headache, and menstrual changes. </li>
        <li>The manufacturer warns that Plan B is not recommended for routine       use as a contraceptive. </li>
      </ul>

      <h1>RU486/Abortion  Pill</h1>
      <p> Before taking RU486, or Abortion Pill, you should  understand what it is, what it could mean to your health and how it works. Call  for an appointment and one of our staff will be happy to discuss it with you,  confirm if you're pregnant and advise you on your options.</p>
      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p>RU-486, also known as “the abortion pill,” is actually a  combination of two drugs -- mifepristone and misoprostol -- that cause early  abortion. It should not be used if it has been more than 7 weeks since your  last period. It is NOT the same as the “morning after pill.”</p>
      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>The first pill, mifepristone, is taken orally and blocks  the hormone progesterone needed to maintain the pregnancy. The second pill,  misoprostol, is inserted into the vagina 24 to 72 hours later, causing the  uterus to contract and expel the placenta and embryo.</p>
      <h2>Things to Consider</h2>
      <p>An RU-486 abortion requires 3 visits to a health care  provider.</p>
      <ul type="square">
        <li>Most medical abortions using mifepristone are completed within 2       weeks, but some can take up to 3 or even 4 weeks. </li>
        <li>Side effects include heavy bleeding, headache, diarrhea, nausea,       vomiting, and cramping. </li>
        <li>If this method fails, a surgical abortion will be required. </li>
      </ul>
