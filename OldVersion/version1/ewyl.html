			<p>Pregnancy can be a time of many questions. You may wonder what is normal, what labor and delivery will be like, 
			and what to expect while parenting an infant.  It can be overwhelming. Here at Lifeline Pregnancy Help Clinic, 
			we have a program that can help ease some of this uncertainty! It is called “Earn While You Learn.” (EWYL).</p>
			<p>When you participate in EWYL, you will have access to helpful information on a number of topics related to pregnancy 
			and parenting. Topics like what to expect in each trimester of your pregnancy; labor and delivery; prenatal nutrition; 
			breastfeeding; newborn care and nutrition; bonding with your infant; and many more! The lessons will be tailored to your 
			individual needs.</p>
			<p>As an added benefit, with each lesson you successfully complete in EWYL you will earn points that can be used in our boutique. 
			These points can be used to purchase items such as baby clothes, diapers, and newborn care products; or bigger items like car 
			seats and baby furniture (based upon availability).</p>
			<p>This program is provided completely free of charge! If you are interested and would like more information or to make an 
			appointment, call us at Lifeline- (660)665-5688. Or you can come by our clinic at 306 W. Washington here in Kirksville. 
			We hope to see you soon!</p>
