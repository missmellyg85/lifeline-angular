			<h1>Abortion Education</h1><img align="right" src="assets/images/abortion.jpg" width="204" height="274" />
			<p>If you are thinking about abortion, please contact us before you make a final  choice. We are here to help you sort through all of your questions and  concerns. There is a lot to educate yourself on before you make a decision, and  we are here to help you every step of the way.
			<b>Our center offers peer counseling and accurate information about all  pregnancy options; however we do not offer or refer for abortion services.</b></p> 
			<h2>Methods of Abortion</h2>
			<p><strong>RU486, Mifepristone: (Abortion Pill) </strong>- Within <em>4 to 7 weeks</em> after LMP<br />
			This drug is only approved for use in women up to the 49th day after their last  menstrual period. The procedure usually requires three office visits. On the  first visit, the woman is given pills to cause the death of the embryo. Two  days later, if the abortion has not occurred, she is given a second drug which  causes cramps to expel the embryo. The last visit is a follow up ultrasound to  determine if the procedure has been completed. RU486 will not work in the case of an ectopic pregnancy.  This is a potentially life-threatening condition in which the embryo lodges  outside of the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube. If not diagnosed early,  the tube may burst, causing internal bleeding and in some cases, the death of  the woman.</p>
			<p><strong>Manual Vacuum Aspiration</strong>:  up to <em>7 weeks</em> after last menstrual period (LMP)<br />
			This surgical abortion is done early in the pregnancy up until 7 weeks after  the woman's last menstrual period. A long, thin tube is inserted into the  uterus. A large syringe is attached to the tube and the embryo is suctioned  out.</p>
			<p><strong>Suction Curettage:</strong> between <em>6 to 14 weeks</em> after LMP<br />
			This is the most common surgical abortion procedure. Because the baby is  larger, the doctor must first stretch open the cervix using metal rods. Opening  the cervix may be painful, so local or general anesthesia is typically needed.  After the cervix is stretched open, the doctor inserts a hard plastic tube into  the uterus, and then connects this tube to a suction machine. The suction pulls  the fetus' body apart and out of the uterus. The doctor may also use a  loop-shaped knife called a curette to scrape the fetus and fetal parts out of  the uterus. (The doctor may refer to the fetus and fetal parts as the “products  of conception.”)</p>
			<h3> Abortion is not just a simple procedure; it may have many  side effects. Abortion has been associated with preterm birth, emotional and  psychological impact, and spiritual consequences. Please contact our center so  that you can make an informed decision.</h3>
			<p><strong>Dilation and Evacuation (D&amp;E)</strong>:  between 13 to 24 weeks after LMP<br />
			This surgical abortion is done during the second trimester of pregnancy. At  this point in pregnancy, the fetus is too large to be broken up by suction  alone and will not pass through the suction tubing. In this procedure, the  cervix must be opened wider than in a first trimester abortion. This is done by  inserting numerous thin rods made of seaweed a day or two before the abortion.  Once the cervix is stretched open the doctor pulls out the fetal parts with  forceps. The fetus' skull is crushed to ease removal. A sharp tool (called a  curette) is also used to scrape out the contents of the uterus, removing any  remaining tissue.</p>
			<p><strong>Dilation and Extraction (D&amp;X)  (partial-birth abortion)</strong>: from 20 weeks after LMP to  full-term<br />
			This procedure takes three days. During the first two days, the cervix is  stretched open using thin rods made of seaweed, and medication is given for  pain. On the third day, the abortion doctor uses ultrasound to locate the legs  of the fetus. Grasping a leg with forceps, the doctor delivers the fetus up to  the head. Next, scissors are inserted into the base of the skull to create an  opening. A suction catheter is placed into the opening to remove the brain. The  skull collapses and the fetus is removed.</p>
